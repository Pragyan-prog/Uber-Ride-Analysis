# Uber-Ride-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride data to derive insights into ride patterns, customer behavior, driver performance, and operational efficiency. By using SQL for data extraction and manipulation
# Project Overview
Uber generates a large volume of data related to rides, drivers, and customer behavior. 

This project aims to:

Data Analysis: Use SQL to query and analyze key metrics related to rides, customers, and drivers.
# Key Objectives:
Extract and clean Uber ride data using SQL.
Analyze ride patterns, customer preferences, and driver performance.
# Dataset:
Dataset The dataset used in this project contains information such as:

Ride Details: Trip ID, date, time, pickup and drop-off locations, distance traveled, and fare amount.

Customer Information: Demographics and feedback.

Driver Information: Driver ID, ratings, total trips, and performance metrics.
# Tool used:
SQL: For data extraction, querying, and analysis.
# SQL Techniques:
Joins: To merge data from multiple tables (rides, customers, and drivers).

Aggregations: To calculate metrics like total rides, revenue, and average trip distance.

Filters & Conditions: To isolate specific data segments, such as rides from certain locations or times.

Group By: To analyze data by categories such as customer type, ride distance, or time period.
